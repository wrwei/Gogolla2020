\section{Conclusions and Further Work}
\label{sec:conclusions}

In this paper we have argued that it is important for model management languages to extend their scope beyond the narrow boundaries of 3-level metamodelling architectures such as MOF and EMF. In this direction, we have experimented with  using an OCL-based imperative transformation language to query data stored in relational databases. We have reported on the identified challenges and proposed an approach for improving the performance of some types of queries using run-time query translation.

In future iterations of this work, we plan to investigate the extent to which compile-time static analysis and query rewriting can deliver additional benefits in terms of performance. An obvious target is to use static analysis to limit the number of columns returned by queries by excluding any columns that are never accessed in the model management program, but additional optimisations are also envisioned. We also plan to investigate supporting queries spanning more than one tables by exploiting foreign keys.
