\section{Introduction}

Information that can potentially be of interest in the context of a Model Driven Engineering process is often located within non-model artefacts such as spreadsheets, XML documents and relational databases. As such, model management languages and tools would arguably benefit from extending their scope beyond the narrow boundaries of 3-level metamodelling architectures such as EMF and MOF for MDE.

In previous work, we have demonstrated how OCL-based model management (e.g. model validation, model-to-text and model-to-model transformation) languages of the Epsilon platform \cite{EpsilonICECCS} can be used to interact with plain XML documents~\cite{EpsilonXML} and spreadsheets~\cite{EpsilonSpreadsheets}. In this work we investigate the challenges involved in using such languages to query large relational datasets and extract abstract models that can be then used (e.g. analysed, validated, transformed) in the context of MDE processes. In particular, we identify the challenges imposed by the size of such datasets and the conceptual gap between the organisation of relational databases and the object-oriented syntax of OCL-based languages, and we propose some solutions.

The rest of the paper is organised as follows. In Section \ref{sec:approach} we present a running example that involves querying a real-world large relational dataset and extracting an EMF model from it using an OCL-based imperative transformation language, we identify the performance challenges involved in doing so, and propose a run-time query translation approach that addresses some of these challenges. In Section \ref{sec:background}, we review previous work on using OCL to query relational datasets and compare our approach to it, and in Section \ref{sec:conclusions} we conclude the paper and provide directions for further work.
