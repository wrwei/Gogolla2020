Relational database management systems are used to store and manage large sets of data, subsets of which can be of interest in the context of Model Driven Engineering processes. 

To enable seamless integration of information stored in relational databases in an MDE process, the technical and conceptual gap between the two technical spaces needs to be bridged. 
In this paper we investigate the challenges involved in querying large relational datasets using an imperative OCL-based model management language (EOL) through running examples, and we propose solutions for some of these challenges.
