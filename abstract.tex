	Relational database management systems are used to store and manage large sets of data.
	In practical Model Driven Engineering (MDE) development processes, information stored in relational databases may be of interest.
	To enable seamless integration of information stored in relational databases in an MDE process, the technical and conceptual gap between the two technical spaces needs to be bridged. 
	In this paper, we investigate the challenges involved in querying large relational datasets using an imperative OCL-based model management language (Epsilon Object Language) through running examples, and we propose solutions for some of these challenges.
