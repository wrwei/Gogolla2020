\section{Querying Large Relational Datasets: Challenges and Solutions}
\label{sec:approach}

The Epsilon Object Language \cite{EOL} is an OCL-based imperative model query and transformation language. EOL is the core language of the Epsilon platform and underpins a number of task-specific languages for model management tasks including model validation, model-to-model and model-to-text transformation. As such, by adding support for querying relational datasets to EOL, this capability is automatically propagated to all task-specific languages of the platform. While the discussion in the rest of the paper focuses on EOL, in principle the discussion and solutions proposed are also relevant to a wide range of OCL-based model management languages such as QVTo, ATL and Kermeta.

To experiment with querying relational datasets with EOL, we selected a large real-world publicly-available dataset from the US Bureau of Transportation Statistics\footnote{\url{http://www.transtats.bts.gov/DL_SelectFields.asp?Table_ID=236&DB_Short_Name=On-Time}} that records all domestic flights in the US in January 2013. The dataset consists of one table (Flight) with 223 columns and 506,312 rows and is 221MB when persisted in MySQL. Each row of the table records the details of a domestic flight during that month, including the short codes of its origin and destination airports, the flight's departure and arrival time etc. An excerpt of the Flight table appears in Figure \ref{fig:database}. 

Our aim in this running example is to transform this dataset into an EMF model that conforms to the metamodel of Figure \ref{fig:atms} and which captures the incoming and outgoing routes for each airport as well as the volume of traffic on these routes, so that we can then further process the EMF model to discover interesting facts about the structure of the US airport network.

\subsection{Finding the number of airports in the network}

A reasonable OCL-like expression\footnote{EOL does away with the ocl- prefixes (e.g. oclAsSet()) and the $\rightarrow$ OCL operator and uses . instead for all property/method calls.} that can be used to retrieve the number of all distinct airports\footnote{We assume that there are no airports with only incoming or outgoing flights and as such, looking into one of \emph{origin}, \emph{dest} should suffice.} in the Flight table would be:

\begin{lstlisting}
Flight.allInstances.origin.asSet().size()
\end{lstlisting}

When such an expression is evaluated against an in-memory model (e.g. an EMF model) the EOL execution engine performs the following steps:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item It inspects the model and computes a collection of all model elements of type Flight;
  \item It iterates through the contents of the collection computed in step 1 and collects the values of their \emph{origin} properties in a new collection;
  \item It removes all duplicates from the collection computed in step 2;
  \item It computes the size of the collection computed in step 3.
\end{enumerate}

To evaluate the same expression against the relational database discussed above, we can assume that each table in the database is a type and each row in the table is a model element that is an instance of that type. Under these assumptions, the following issues emerge:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item To compute the \emph{Flight.allInstances} collection, the engine needs to execute the following SQL query: \emph{select * from Flight}. Due to the size of the Flight table, the returned result-set cannot fit in a reasonable amount of heap space (we experimented with up to 1GB), and as such it needs to be streamed from the database to the engine instead. Streamed result-sets demonstrate the following challenges:
  \subitem They support forward-only iteration;
  \subitem To calculate the size of a streamed result-set it needs to be exhaustively iterated (in which case it becomes unusable as only forward iteration is permitted);
  \subitem Each database connection cannot support more than one streamed result-sets at a time.
  \item Iterating through all rows of the Flight table through a streamed result set and collecting the values of the \emph{origin} column of each row is particularly inefficient given that the same result can be achieved at a fraction of the time using the following SQL statement: \emph{select origin from Flight};
  \item Eliminating duplicates by iterating the collection computed in step 2 is also inefficient as the same result can be achieved using the following -- more efficient -- SQL statement: \emph{select distinct origin from Flight};
  \item Finally, calculating the size of a streamed result-set is not trivial without invalidating the result-set itself. By contrast, this could be computed in one step using the following SQL statement: \emph{select count(distinct origin) from Flight}.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Finding adjunct airports}

Assuming that we have computed a set containing the short codes of all airports in the table, the next task is to find for each airport, which other airports are directly connected to it, and then compute the volume of traffic between each pair of adjunct airports. An imperative EOL program that can be used to achieve this follows:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=EOL, numbers=left]
var origins = Flight.allInstances.origin.asSet();
for (origin in origins) {
	var destinations = Flight.allInstances.dest.asSet();
	for (destination in destinations) {
		var numberOfFlights = Flight.allInstances.
			select(f|f.origin = origin and f.dest = destination).
				size();
	}
}
\end{lstlisting}

The following observations can be made for the program above:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Although the \emph{destinations} result-set computed in line 3 does not change, it needs to be re-computed for every nested iteration as the result of the computation is streamed, and therefore only permits forward navigation;
  \item Unless care is taken to evaluate the right-hand side expressions in lines 1 and 3 using different database connections, the program will fail (as discussed above, each MySQL connection only permits at most one streamed result-set at a time);
  \item Iterating through all the rows of the Flight table in the \emph{select(\ldots)} method in lines 5-7 is inefficient, particularly as the same result can be computed using the following SQL statement \emph{select count(*) from Flight where origin=? and destination=?} (where \emph{?} should be replaced every time with the appropriate origin/destination values).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Runtime SQL Query Generation}

%By now, readers should be convinced that querying relational datasets using OCL-like languages is a really bad idea in terms of performance, and that SQL is a more natural and performant language to query such data. 

In this section we argue that while the naive way of evaluating OCL-like queries on relational datasets can dramatically degrade performance (as shown in the previous section), there are certain runtime optimisations that the execution engine can perform to significantly reduce the execution time and memory footprint of some types of queries.

After applying such optimisations, the following EOL transformation, can transform the complete dataset (DB) in question to an EMF-based model (ATMS) that conforms to the metamodel of Figure \ref{fig:atms} in less than 45 seconds on average hardware\footnote{CPU: 2.66 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo, RAM: 8 GB DDR3.}. A visualisation of an excerpt of the extracted model appears in Figure \ref{fig:model}.

The functionality of the transformation is outlined below:
\begin{itemize}
  \item In line 1 it creates a new instance of the \emph{Model} EClass in the ATMS EMF (target) model;
  \item In line 2 it computes a set of all origin airports in the Flight table;
  \item In line 4 it iterates through the set of strings computed in line 2;
  \item In line 5 it invokes the \emph{airportForName} method defined in lines 21-30 which returns an instance of the \emph{Airport} EClass in the target model with a matching name;
  \item In lines 6-7 it computes a set of adjunct airports to the origin airport;
  \item In lines 10-12 for each adjunct airport (destination), it computes the number of flights between the two airports;
  \item In lines 13-16 it creates a new instance of the \emph{Route} EClass in the target model and populates its origin, destination and numberOfFlights properties.
  \item The \emph{airportForName()} method in lines 21-30 is responsible for preventing the creation of airports with duplicate names in the target model.
\end{itemize}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=EOL, label=lst:eol, caption=EOL transformation, numbers=left]
var m : new ATMS!Model;
var origins = DB!Flight.allInstances.origin.asSet();

for (origin in origins) {
	var originAirport = airportForName(origin);
	var destinations = DB!Flight.allInstances.
		select(f|f.origin = origin).dest.asSet();
	
	for (destination in destinations) {
		var numberOfFlights = DB!Flight.allInstances.
			select(f|f.origin = origin and f.dest = destination)
				.size();
		var route = new ATMS!Route;
		route.origin = originAirport;
		route.destination = airportForName(destination);
		route.numberOfFlights = numberOfFlights.asInteger();
	}
	
}

operation airportForName(name : String) {
	var airport = ATMS!Airport.allInstances.
		selectOne(a|a.name = name);
		
	if (airport.isUndefined()) {
		airport = new ATMS!Airport;
		airport.name = name;
		m.airports.add(airport);
	}
	return airport;
}
\end{lstlisting}

\end{figure}

To achieve an acceptable level of performance, we have extended the EOL execution engine to use streamed \emph{lazy collections} and a runtime OCL to SQL query translation strategy for certain types of OCL expressions when the latter are evaluated against relational datasets. Each lazy collection acts as a wrapper for an SQL query generated at runtime and only starts streaming data from the database if/when it needs to be iterated. This prevents unnecessary database queries and enables multi-step query translation at runtime. An example of the query translation process is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:query} which calculates the average delay of flights flying from JFK to LAX on Sundays. In particular, the following OCL expressions are rewritten as SQL queries.

\begin{description}
	\item \textbf{.allInstances} Retrieving all the rows of a table in the database returns a streamed lazy collection (\emph{ResultSetList}) that is backed by a \emph{select * from <table>} SQL expression. For example, \emph{Flight.allInstances} is translated to \emph{select * from Flight}.
	
	\item \textbf{.select(<iterator>\textbar<condition>)} \emph{ResultSetList} overrides the built-in OCL select operation, translates the EOL condition to an SQL expression, and returns a new \emph{ResultSetList} constrained by the latter. 
	For example, \emph{Flight. allInstances.select(f \textbar f.origin = "JFK" and f.dayOfWeek=1)} is translated into \emph{select * from Flight where origin = ? and dayOfWeek = ?} (the values of the parameters -- i.e. JFK and 1 -- are kept separately and are only used if the query needs to be executed). The condition can contain references to the columns of the table, arithmetic, and logical operators at arbitrary levels of nesting. The \emph{exists()}, \emph{forAll()} and \emph{reject()} OCL operations behave similarly.
	\item\textbf{.collect(<iterator>\textbar<expression>)} \emph{ResultSetList} overrides the built-in OCL collect() operation to return a streamed lazy collection of primitive values (\emph{PrimitiveValuesList}). For example, \emph{Flight.all.collect(f \textbar f.dest + "-" + f.origin)} is translated to \emph{select origin + "-" + dest from Flight}. In the spirit of OCL, retrieving properties of collections is a short-hand notation for collect(). For example, \emph{Flight.allInstances.dest} is shorthand for \emph{Flight.allInstances. collect(f \textbar f.dest)}.
	
	\item \textbf{.size()} Calls to the size() method of a \emph{ResultSetList}/\emph{PrimitiveValuesList} are interpreted as \emph{count} SQL queries. For example \emph{Flight.allInstances.size()} is translated to \emph{select count(*) from Flight}.

	\item\textbf{asSet()} Calls to asSet() method of a \emph{PrimitiveValuesList} return a new \emph{PrimitiveValuesList} backed by a \emph{distinct} SQL query. For example, \emph{Flight.allInstances. dest.asSet()} returns a new \emph{PrimitiveValuesList} backed by the following SQL query: \emph{select distinct(dest) from Flight}. 

\end{description}

\begin{figure}
 \centering
		\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/query.pdf}
	\caption{Multi-step SQL query generation process}
	\label{fig:query}
\end{figure}

Streamed lazy collections also provide a \emph{fetch()} method that executes their underpinning query and returns a complete in-memory result-set which is navigable in both directions. This is useful for small result-sets where the overhead of maintaining the entire result-set is memory is preferable to the performance overhead of streaming. To address the limitation of one streamed result-set per connection, we are using a pool of connections for streamed result-sets: each streamed result-set requests a connection from the pool when it needs to be computed and returns it back to the pool when it has been fully iterated.

%\begin{itemize}
%  \item Evaluating an \emph{.allInstances} expression on a type X originating from a relational dataset (e.g. \emph{DB!Flight.allInstances}) returns a streamed lazy collection (\emph{ResultSetList}) that is backed by a \emph{select * from X} SQL query, which is not executed until the collection starts being iterated;
%  \item Evaluating a \emph{.size()} expression on a streamed\emph{ResultSetList} executes an SQL count query (i.e. \emph{select count(*) from X}) instead of iterating through the contents of the list;

%\subsection{Extracted Facts}
%
%Some interesting facts that may or may not end up in the paper due to space restrictions.
%
%\begin{itemize}
%  \item There are 306 airports in the dataset. Of these, 68 are connected directly to only 1 other airport;
%  \item After running Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm for all airports in the model, it was found that the most distant pair of airports in the network are Leihigh Valley International Airport (ABE) and Wiley Post-Will Rogers Memorial Airport (BRW). A passenger wishing to travel between the two would need to change 4 flights (ABE$\rightarrow$DTW$\rightarrow$SEA$\rightarrow$FAI$\rightarrow$BRW);
%  \item The Atlanta International Airport (ATL) is the busiest airport in terms of the number of flights that go through it (67,717), followed by ORD, DFW, DEN, LAX and IAH;
%  \item ATL is also the best-connected airport with direct flights to 148 airports in the country;
%  \item ORD and DEN are the best-connected airports in terms of the number of airports that passengers can reach with direct or 1-stop flights (301), followed by ATL, IAH and DFW (294), and DTW (292);
%  \item \textgreater50\% of all the flights go through the 18 busiest airports and \textgreater90\% of all flights go through the 91 busiest airports.
